# Customer-Purchase-Predictions

In the current highly competitive business environment, having a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior is essential for any organization striving for success. The ability to predict customer purchasing trends and identify potential new clients has become a crucial skill for companies looking to increase revenue, build long-lasting customer relationships, or minimize marketing attrition. With the evolution and complexity of data, traditional market analysis techniques are no longer sufficient. Online businesses face the challenge of converting a significant portion of their website traffic into paying customers.

Businesses are constantly trying to connect with their target customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. To do this, they need effective solutions that can provide targeted answers. They require models that can adapt to changing trends, handle a wide range of data collection techniques, provide real-time forecasts, and make accurate predictions. One such method is propensity modelling, which uses machine learning and predictive analytics to anticipate customers' purchasing behavior. Through my work, I aim to provide businesses with an innovative technique that can not only predict new customers but also understand the factors that influence their purchasing decisions by creating a robust Customer Propensity Model.
